# Ejercicios de Diseño de Bases de Datos

### Iteration 1

The following ER diagrams represent two views of a video store database as described to a data-
base designer. Show how the two views can be integrated in the simplest and most useful way by making all necessary changes on the two diagrams.

State any assumptions you need to make.

### Iteration 2

a. Transform your integrated ER diagram into an SQL database with five to ten rows per table of data you can make up to fit the database schema.

b. Demonstrate your database by displaying all the following queries:

1. Which video store branches have Shrek in stock (available) now?
2. In what section of the store (film category) can you find The Terminator?
3. For customer Annika Sorenstam, what titles are currently being rented and what are the overdue
charges, if any?
4. (Any query of your choice—show what your system can really do!)
